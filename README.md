# Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute SDK
This Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute software developer kit (NCSDK) is provided for users of the [Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick](https://developer.movidius.com/) (Intel® Movidius™ NCS). It includes software tools, an API, and examples, so developers can create software that takes advantage of the accelerated neural network capability provided by the Intel Movidius NCS hardware.

 
# Installation
The provided Makefile helps with installation. Clone this repository and then run the following command to install the NCSDK:

```
make install
```

# Examples
The Neural Compute SDK also includes examples. After cloning and running 'make install,' run the following command to install the examples:
```
make examples
```

## NCAPPZOO Examples
For additional examples, please see the Neural Compute App Zoo available at [http://www.github.com/movidius/ncappzoo](http://www.github.com/movidius/ncappzoo). The ncappzoo is a valuable resource for NCS users and includes community developed applications and neural networks for the NCS.
